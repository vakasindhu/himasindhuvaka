          <h3>Associate Consultant</h3>
          <p><strong>Oracle</strong> — Bangalore, India | Jun 2023 – Dec 2024</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Joining Oracle as an Associate Consultant marked the beginning of my professional journey in the technology industry. I was part of the team responsible for implementing and customizing core banking solutions for global clients, where I had the chance to collaborate closely with banking professionals, business analysts, and engineers.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work primarily focused on improving the performance, reliability, and user experience of banking platforms. I designed and developed REST APIs, created internal tools using Oracle APEX, and worked on integrating third-party services with existing systems. I was also involved in solution deployment, production support, and client demonstrations, which helped me build strong communication and problem-solving skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most impactful aspects of my time at Oracle was learning how enterprise-scale financial systems operate behind the scenes — from backend workflows and database design to regulatory compliance and client-specific customization. It was an experience that taught me not just the technical skills, but also how to approach problems with a solutions-oriented mindset and deliver value in a business context.

          <p>
            My internship at CG Enterprises introduced me to the financial and analytical side of business operations. I worked on budgeting and forecasting processes, analyzed spending data, and contributed to building workflows that improved the way financial information was tracked and reported.
          </p>

          <p>
            I collaborated with different departments to gather data, built financial dashboards, and assisted in preparing detailed financial reports used for decision-making by the leadership team. I also had the opportunity to work with tools like Excel, SQL, and ERP systems, which deepened my understanding of how financial technology supports business growth.
          </p>

          <p>
            This experience was instrumental in shaping how I think about data — not just as numbers, but as a story that reflects the health and direction of a business. It gave me a foundation in financial analysis, reporting, and communication that continues to influence how I approach data-driven projects today.

            <p><strong>Category:</strong> Machine Learning</p>

            <p>
              I developed a system to detect malicious websites by analyzing their URLs. The goal was to help users avoid phishing attacks without relying solely on browser warnings. Using Python and Scikit-Learn, I trained a machine learning model to recognize subtle patterns in URLs that indicate potential threats. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The model can classify websites in real-time and reached an accuracy of 92%, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining feature engineering with supervised learning. This project strengthened my understanding of cybersecurity challenges and practical machine learning deployment.

              <p>
                In response to public health safety needs, I developed a Python system that monitors social distancing in real-time using camera feeds. Leveraging TensorFlow and OpenCV, the system detects people and measures distances between them, triggering alerts when social distancing is violated.
              </p>

              <p>
                By optimizing the algorithm, I reduced alert latency by 40%, enabling timely notifications in crowds of 50+ people. This project taught me how to balance speed and accuracy in real-time computer vision applications.

          <p><strong>Lets Help Us (NGO)</strong> — Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India | Apr 2020 – Present</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            “Lets Help Us” started as a small idea between friends during the COVID-19 pandemic — to support people in our community who were struggling with access to essentials. What began as distributing food and medical kits soon grew into a larger volunteer-driven organization that provided emergency support across multiple regions.
          </p>

          <p>
            As one of the founding members, I was deeply involved in almost every aspect of our operations — from organizing donation drives and coordinating logistics to leading teams of volunteers and building partnerships with local authorities. I also played a key role in expanding our efforts beyond pandemic relief to include disaster response during floods and other natural calamities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The experience taught me leadership, empathy, resilience, and how to build something meaningful from the ground up. It remains one of the most fulfilling parts of my journey — showing me that technology and teamwork can create real-world impact beyond professional boundaries.

          <h3>Finance Manager</h3>
          <p><strong>The Hindu Education Plus Club</strong> — Vellore, India | Jul 2019 – Nov 2020</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            During my undergraduate studies, I served as Finance Manager for the Education Plus Club, a student-run initiative supported by <em>The Hindu</em>. In this role, I was responsible for managing budgets, planning financial strategies, and ensuring that the club’s events and literacy programs were executed smoothly.
          </p>

          <p>
            I worked closely with student leaders to allocate funds efficiently, secured sponsorships for events, and implemented structured financial tracking systems. This role helped me develop organizational and decision-making skills, as well as the ability to manage multiple responsibilities while collaborating with diverse teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the financial responsibilities, this experience also gave me a strong sense of ownership and leadership, shaping how I approach collaborative projects and manage resources effectively — skills that continue to serve me in professional environments today.
